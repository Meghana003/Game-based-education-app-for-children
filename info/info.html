    Not eating too many sweets
    Brushing your teeth for at least two minutes, twice a day using a squirt of toothpaste

    Making sure you brush every bit of each tooth – front and back, top and bottom!
    Visiting your dentist at least once a year

                We all need to spend some time in the sunshine so that our bodies can make Vitamin D.
                 But we need to make sure that we are staying safe in the sun.
                 Too much time in the sun can also lead to sunstroke – this is when your body overheats and you feel sick and dizzy.

Everyone experiences a range of feelings, and that’s normal- feelings make up who we are. The way you feel, learn and behave are all because of your character.

The good news is, you can work on your character as you grow and become the best version of yourself.

Puberty is the time when your body changes from a child's to an adult's. Puberty happens to girls and boys between the ages of 8 and 16 years and it's a normal part of growing up. Not everybody starts puberty at the same time.

    Limit the  amount of sugary and salty foods you eat each day, like biscuits, chocolate and crisps.
    Foods like potatoes, bread, cereals, rice and pasta should make up about a third of the food you eat.
    Milk, cheese and yoghurt are great sources of calcium which make teeth and bones strong.
    Meat, fish, eggs and beans give us protein, vitamins and minerals which help us grow strong and healthy.

  Everyone’s eyesight is different, you might know some people who wear glasses or contact lenses and others who don’t need them at all.

  People with eyesight problems can get help by speaking to an optician, who might give them glasses or contact lenses to wear.

  Wearing glasses is really common and is nothing to worry about

  Sleep is really important. With enough sleep, we have the energy we need to get through the day.
  Everyone needs a different amount of sleep and this changes as you grow up.

As a guide, if you’re in primary school you should be getting 10-11 hours’ sleep a night, so that means going to bed between 7 and 8pm every night.
